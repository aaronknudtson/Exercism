1. memcpy from c/list-ops/list-ops.c line 11 - is it fine to use, and is it more efficient?
2. Pattern I see: Declare type struct, create modifier functions library, initialize struct variable, pass struct variable as a pointer in order to be modified, return error status?
3. What is LLVM?
4. Give me a short rundown of gcc or compiler options?
5. how significant is this "Rust in the linux kernel" (version 6.1 I think)?
